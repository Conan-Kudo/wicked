wickedd:
	- bug: linkUp on an interface that's up never returns the
	  event callback.
	- bug: sometimes wpa supplicant just stops scanning
	- support global (non-interface) routes
	- support ppp: have a deviceNew method that associates a pppN
	  and use deviceChange to bring up pppd.
	- handle SIGTERM/SIGINT: bring down addrconf services, restore
	  resolv.conf etc.
	- write addrconf leases to a file
	- when a wlan device changes association, tell dhcp about it
	  so that it can request a new lease

netinfo:
	- Introduce an <access-provider> abstraction; this can be either
	  a wireless network (ESSID, security information); an Internet
	  dialup network (eg providing a phone number, security information),
	  a mobile IP provider (UMTS), etc.

ifconfig
	- use wpa_supplicant for 802.1x too
	- disable IPv6 on a device if requested
	- support ppp, pppoe

iflist
	- Retrieve ethtool interface statistics

overall
	- Add INSTALL file describing how to build wicked

extensions
	- support openvpn
	- add support conversion to a different file format when running extensions
	- escape/reject shell metacharacters when expanding start/stop command

events
	- how to send events to a number of listeners without
	  blocking on a SOCK_STREAM send?

	  Use SOCK_DGRAM sockets. Listeners establish themselves
	  by sending a LISTEN_ENABLE message to the server,
	  which records the sender address.

	  Any notifications are sent to all recorded listener addresses.
	  If a send fails, the address is removed from the list
	  of listeners.

other link layers, totally unsupported as of yet
	- infiniband
	- token ring
	- isdn, ppp, slip
