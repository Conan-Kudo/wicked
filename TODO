wickedd:
	- bug: linkUp on an interface that's up never returns the
	  event callback.
	- bug: sometimes wpa supplicant just stops scanning
	- support global (non-interface) routes
	- support ppp: have a deviceNew method that associates a pppN
	  and use deviceChange to bring up pppd.
	- handle SIGTERM/SIGINT: bring down addrconf services, restore
	  resolv.conf etc.
	- write addrconf leases to a file
	- when a wlan device changes association, tell dhcp about it
	  so that it can request a new lease
	- express explicit dependencies between devices.
	   <meta:require check="netif-up">eth0</meta:require>
	  or some such.
	- Allow wicked to request event notification when the resolver
	  changes, or when a host becomes reachable?

	- Add a naming service to identify a PCI hotplug device by its
	  enclosure.

ifup replacement features:
	- ifplugd: we could support this in the wicked client using
	  some <policy> element.

	  For each interface marked this way, wicked would background
	  itself, and monitor linkUp/linkDown events.

	- Support all sorts of trigger scripts when interfaces are
	  brought up and down.
	  execute scripts from ifup.d and ifdown.d
	  execute {ifup,ifdown}-connections

	- Make interface selection less messy (unify all the --boot-* and --skip-*
	  options and provide one generic expression mechanism)

netinfo:
	- Introduce an <access-provider> abstraction; this can be either
	  a wireless network (ESSID, security information); an Internet
	  dialup network (eg providing a phone number, security information),
	  a mobile IP provider (UMTS), etc.

ifconfig
	- use wpa_supplicant for 802.1x too
	- disable IPv6 on a device if requested
	- support ppp, pppoe

overall
	- Add INSTALL file describing how to build wicked

extensions
	- add support conversion to a different file format when running extensions
	- escape/reject shell metacharacters when expanding start/stop command

other link layers, totally unsupported as of yet
	- infiniband
	- token ring
	- isdn, ppp, slip
