	* Add support for modem devices, and prepare for ppp support.
	  Modems are handled by the wicked client as "just another device",
	  so a PPP link is really a network device that depends on a
	  "modem thingy" - which allows us to use all the existing
	  FSM for device bring-up without having to special case a lot
	  of stuff.

	* Fairly big rewrite of the logic in the ifup/ifdown layer.
	  Reduced the intrinsic knowledge about interface types and
	  their relationships to zero; all of this is now embedded in
	  the schema.

	* Implement schema validation, and try to do it as early as
	  possible - rather then when we're almost done with bringing
	  up the interface, and *then* notice that the user messed up
	  the config file.

	* Teaching the schema about dependencies, and user-input.
	  Yes, we have a working mechanism to get back to the user
	  for a password or a login name, but it's awkward and probably
	  error prone. Tagging schema nodes is easier, and needs to be
	  implemented only once.

	* Oh yeah, and implement a <require> tag that lets you check
	  whether a given hostname is reachable. To be used with openvpn,
	  for instance, where you don't want to bring up the tunnel
	  daemon before you can actually reach the VPN gateway.
