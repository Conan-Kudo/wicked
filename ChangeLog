	* Fairly big rewrite of the logic in the ifup/ifdown layer.
	  Reduced the intrinsic knowledge about interface types and
	  their relationships to zero; all of this is now embedded in
	  the schema.

	* Implement schema validation, and try to do it as early as
	  possible - rather then when we're almost done with bringing
	  up the interface, and *then* notice that the user messed up
	  the config file.

	* Teaching the schema about dependencies, and user-input.
	  Yes, we have a working mechanism to get back to the user
	  for a password or a login name, but it's awkward and probably
	  error prone. Tagging schema nodes is easier, and needs to be
	  implemented only once.
