<!--
     Sample policy file for network-nanny.

     This will configure any Ethernet device in your system.

     You need to take these steps to enable this policy:

	     wicked nanny enable eth0
	     wicked nanny addpolicy samples/nanny/eth_all.xml

     This will automatically configure the interface when the
     link is up, and bring it down as you lose the link.

     Caveat: at this stage of development, you still need to be root
     to do these things.

   <!-- You can use this to configure specific address conf mechanisms.

     -- policy.
