          The device is identified by its "equipment id" as determined
          by ModemManager. For most GSM USB sticks, this will be the
          IMEI of the GSM card.
          Using this approach is probably a good idea, especially
          if you decide to store the SIM PIN in this file - in which
          case you really want to make sure that you're not using
          the PIN with the wrong device.

          Alternatively, you can match by manufacturer/model, if
          desired, for instance like this:

	    <manufacturer>huawei</manufacturer>
	    <model>e160</model>
	-->

  <!--
    The auth element contains one or more <pin> elements.
    Each of these has a type (which can be any string tag understood
    by ModemManager) and a value

    If you leave the <value> field empty, you will be prompted for it
    by wicked.
