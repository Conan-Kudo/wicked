<!--
     Bridge with static mac address using a dummy.

     Create a dummy interface with hadware/mac address assigned
     and use it as first port in a (initially host-only) bridge
     to use static / avoid random mac address on the bridge as
     well as mac address changesanges of the bridge while other
     ports are added and removed.
