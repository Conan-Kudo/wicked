.SH NAME
ifcfg \- common elements of network interface configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*
.SH VARIABLES
The following is a list of variables that can be put in the
configuration file, with an
example in parentheses.
* marks the default.
For the meaning of
.IR suffix ,
see the section
.BR "Multiple addresses" .
.\" How to keep this in sync with the comments in the sysconfig files?
.\" FIXME: allowed values (see also ## Type:)
.\" example in the following text
.\" ---

.TP
.BR STARTMODE\  { manual* | auto | nfsroot | off }
Choose when the interface should be set up.
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B manual
.br
Interface will be set up if ifup is called manually
.TP
.B auto
.br
Interface will be set up as soon as it is available (and service network was
started). This either happens at boot time when network is starting or via
hotplug when a interface is added to the system (by adding a device or loading a
driver). To be backward compliant
.B onboot\fP,
.B on
and
.B boot
are aliases for
.B auto\fP.
.TP
.B nfsroot
.br
Nearly like
.BR auto ,
but interfaces with this startmode will be not shut down by default.
Use this mode when you use a root filesystem via network or want to avoid interface shutdown.
To force a nfsroot interface down, use ifdown <interface> -o force
.TP
.B off
.br
Will never be activated.
.PD
.RE

.TP
.BR BOOTPROTO\  { static* | dhcp | dhcp4 | dhcp6 | autoip | dhcp+autoip | none }
Setup protocol. If this variable is empty or missing, it defaults to \fBstatic\fR.
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B static
.br
A fixed addresses specified in \fBIPADDR\fR and related variables and static
routing as defined in \fBroutes\fR and \fBifroute-\fR<\fIinterface name\fR>
files is configured.
.TP
.B dhcp4 dhcp6 dhcp
.br
A DHCPv4, DHCPv6 or both clients are started to configure the interface. The
setup is considered successful, when at least one dhcp client configures the
interface. Additionally to the dhcp client configuration, fixed addresses and
routes may also be specified.
.br
.I Note:
.br
Static routes without explicit interfaces will also replace routes to the same
destination (network) configured by dhcp clients on any interface!
.br
Static routes with explicit interface will also replace routes to the same
destination (network) configured by dhcp clients on this interface.
.TP
.B autoip dhcp+autoip
.br
may be used for a IPv4 zeroconf setup or as fall back to autoip if dhcp fails.
.TP
.br
.B none
.br
For bonding slaves, to skip the link-layer (MTU, MAC address) setup and IP
configuration of the interface in ifup. The bonding script handles the link
layer settings itself at enslave time. See also ifcfg-bonding(5) man page.
Note:  Do not use to just skip the IP setup -- use BOOTPROTO="static"
without any addresses in the IPADDR variables (or routes) instead.
.PD

.TP
.IR  \fBIPADDR\fR [ suffix ]\ { IPv4 | IPv6 }[ \fB/\fIPREFIXLEN ]
IP address, either IPv4 or IPv6. You may add
.B /<prefixlength>
in both cases and omit
.B NETMASK
or
.B PREFIXLEN.
If you need more then one IP address use this variable multiple times with
different suffixes added. See section
.B Multiple addresses
below. If no address is configured the interface will just be activated (UP).
.TP
.BR PREFIXLEN [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
Number of bits in IPADDR that form the network
address. Alternatively add a prefix-length to
.B IPADDR
or use
.BR NETMASK .
.B PREFIXLEN
is preferred over
.B NETMASK.
but highest priority has a prefix-length added to the IP address in the variable
.B IPADDR.
.TP
.BR NETMASK [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
Network mask. Alternatively add a prefix-length to
.B IPADDR
or use
.BR PREFIXLEN .
This variable is ignored if a prefix-length is specified.
.TP
.BR BROADCAST [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
Network broadcast. If you omit the broadcast address, it will be calculated from
netmask or prefix-length. You can affect the calculation with the variable
.B DEFAULT_BROADCAST
in
.I /etc/sysconfig/network/config.
See the description there.
.\" ---
.TP
.BR REMOTE_IPADDR [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
The remote IP address of a point to point  connection
.TP
.BR LABEL [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
Each address may be tagged with a label  string.   In  order  to preserve
compatibility  with Linux-2.0 net aliases, this string must coincide with the
name of the device or  must  be  prefixed with the device name followed by
colon.
This may be useful with
.B Multiple addresses
(see below).
.TP
.BR SCOPE [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
The scope of the area where this address is valid.
The available scopes are listed in file
.IR "/etc/iproute2/rt_scopes" .
Predefined scope values are:
.in +8
.B global
- the address is globally valid.
.sp
.B site
- (IPv6 only) the address is site local, i.e. it is
valid inside this site.
.sp
.B link
- the address is link local, i.e. it is valid only on this device.
.sp
.B host
- the address is valid only inside this host.
.in -8
.TP
.BR MTU
Set the maximum transfer unit (MTU) for this interface.
.TP
.BR IP_OPTIONS [ \fIsuffix\fR ]
Any other option you may want to give to the
.B ip add add ...
command. This string is appended to the command.
.TP
.B LLADDR
Set an individual link layer address (MAC address).
.TP
.B LINK_OPTIONS
Here you may add any option valid with
.B ip link set up ...
.TP
.B INTERFACETYPE
In case ifup cannot determine the interface type properly, you may
specify the correct type in this variable to override the behavior
and force ifup to handle the interface differently than it detected
from system or config.
Please always open a bug report when it is required to set the type.
.TP
.B ETHERDEVICE
Needed only for virtual LANs (802.1q). It contains the real interface to use for the vlan
interface. See
.B ifcfg-vlan
.BR (5)
manual page.
.TP
.B BONDING_MASTER, BONDING_SLAVE_*, BONDING_OPTS, BONDING_MODULE_OPTS
These are used to set up interface bonding. See
.B ifcfg-bonding
.BR (5)
manual page.

.SH Multiple addresses

You can extend the variable name
.B IPADDR
by any string you like. For example
.BR IPADDR_1 ,
.B IPADDR-FOO
or
.BR IPADDRxxx.
Use these variables for your IP addresses.
If you need some additional parameters for these addresses, then just add
the same extension to these variable names:
.B BROADCAST, NETMASK, PREFIXLEN, REMOTE_IPADDR, LABEL, SCOPE, IP_OPTIONS.

Example:
   IPADDR_AAA=1.2.3.4
   NETMASK_AAA=255.0.0.0
   BROADCAST_AAA=1.2.3.55
   IPADDR_BBB=10.10.2.3/16
   LABEL_BBB=BBB
   and so on ...
