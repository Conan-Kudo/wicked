.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwickedd\fP provides a service for managing network interfaces. It monitors the
system's interfaces by retrieving relevant information from the kernel
via netlink, sysfs and other interfaces.
.PP
It can be accessed via a DBus service, which can be used to reconfigure
interfaces, bring them up or take them down.
